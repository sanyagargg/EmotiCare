            <div>Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. <br> <br>
            Conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety can all affect one's mental health. <br> <br>
            We must help promote the mental well-being of individuals and address the needs of those with defined mental disorders. <br> <br>
            Around <span>1 in 5</span> children and adolescents in the world have a mental disorder.</div>
            <div><span>264 million</span> people in the world are affected by depression. <br><br>
            Half of the mental health disorders begin before <span>age fourteen.</span> <br><br>
            <span>Every 40 seconds</span> one person dies from suicide. <br><br>
            People with severe mental disorders die <span>10-20 years earlier</span> than the general population.</div>
            <div>Rates of mental health workers can reach <span>below 0.00002%</span> of the population in low-income countries. <br><br>
            The global economy loses <span>$1,000,000,000,000</span> per year due to depression and anxiety. <br><br>
            <span>Over 40%</span> of countries have no mental health policy. <br><br>
            <span>Up to 60%</span> of people with depression can recover with a proper combination of anti-depressants and psychotherapy. <br><br>
            Around <span>one billion</span> people globally have a mental or substance-use disorder.</div>
            <div>Mental health disorders are more prevalent in <span>women and the poor.</span> <br><br>
            <span>Nine out of ten people</span> with mental health problems say that stigma and discrimination have a negative effect on their lives </div>

            <span>Key Facts <br></span>
                <ul><li>Globally, one in seven 10-19-year-olds experiences a mental disorder, accounting for 13% of the global burden of disease in this age group.</li>
                <li>Depression, anxiety and behavioural disorders are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents.</li>
                <li>The consequences of failing to address adolescent mental health conditions extend to adulthood, impairing both physical and mental health and limiting opportunities to lead fulfilling lives as adults.</li>

                Developing a set of coping mechanisms can make all the difference. And there are no limits as to what works to soothe, silence or distract from those suicidal thoughts.</div>
                <article id="listen1"><div>Bottle up one’s emotions for too long and you run the risk of exploding: “It’s much easier to push it down and ignore it. But at one point it's going to explode,” says Shafiqah, adding that she learnt it the hard way.  <br>
                    <span> “When I feel really down and suicidal, I let myself cry and feel [the emotions]. At least I will be feeling in that moment, and would be able to let it go. If not, it would be piling over and over until a point where I cannot take it.”</span>
                     <br>- <span class="myname">Shafiqah Ramani</span></div>
                 <div>Communicating with friends and loved ones is what Nicole and Jolyn turn to in times of need and distress. Even if it means being on the receiving end of criticism. <br>
 
                    <span> “Sometimes their harsh words remind me that things cannot always go my way. And sometimes my way is not the best way. I [also] distract myself every day with work, friends and family.” </span> <br>
                     
                     “I found comfort in some of my friends,” says Jolyn. “At first I didn't want to tell them about [my] suicide attempt, but I needed to open up… I told people whom I trust that will not judge me, and will be there for me when I need them.”
                     <br>- <span class="myname">Nicole Voon</span></div>
                 <div><span>Taking it a day at a time</span> <br><br>
                 <span>Anything can happen, but I don't focus on what can happen to lead me to kill myself. I focus on, ‘’Wow, I’m going to see my daughter [who lives in England], because that's what I want to do.’ Yeah, it's day by day, because that's just how my mind works.”
                     </span> <br>- <span class="myname">Mahita Vas</span> <br><br>
                     Living through the ups and downs of being “super positive” and then “depressed” has taught Nicole the power of compassion and equanimity.  <br>
                <span> “Instead of being a super positive person or a super depressed person, I'm somewhere in between now, which is good, because sometimes average is good.”</span><br>
 But while the suicidal thoughts linger, Nicole tells herself, “‘No, not today, I'm too busy. I have a baby, a business, a husband to take care of.' To live with it is not as bad [as before]. I'm in a much better place with positive people around me.” <br>- <span>Nicole Voon</span>
