            <div class="portion-heading">Undestand that your support is important.</div>
            <div class="portion-body">The small things we say or do can make a big difference to the person going through a mental struggle. 
            Even a simple recognition of someone's struggles can offer great relief to that person.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="help-others-portion-right">

            <div class="portion-heading">Do not be afraid to start the conversation.</div>
            <div class="portion-body">Due to mental health stigma, a person may not feel comfortable starting the conversation around their struggles. 
            Do not be afraid to take the first move. They will greatly appreciate it, even if they do not explicitly say so at first.</div>
        </div>

            <div class="portion-heading">Try your best not to feel upset or get emotional.</div>
            <div class="portion-body">It is normal to feel upset if someone you care about is struggling. But staying calm and composed will give them 
            more self-assurance and increase their confidence to openly talk about their struggles.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="help-others-portion-right">

            <div class="portion-heading">Stay connected and check up on them.</div>
            <div class="portion-body">Do not feel obliged to always be there for them, but staying connected (physically or virtually) and checking up 
            on them every once in a while will give them much needed support if they are going through a tough period.</div>

            <div class="portion-heading">Offer practical help whenever you can.</div>
            <div class="portion-body">Little acts of kindness, like offering to do the groceries for them, doing the dishes for them, or going to 
            appointments with them will offer extensive psychological support and re-assure them that you will always be there for them.</div>
        </div>

            <div class="portion-heading">Do not force your support or go behind their backs.</div>
            <div class="portion-body">Do not force someone to talk to you or get help if they feel uncomfortable, and especially do not go to a 
            professional on their behalf. This will make them feel powerless and think that they cannot speak for themselves.</div>
        </div>

            <div class="portion-heading">Take care of yourself throughout the process.</div>
            <div class="portion-body">When taking care of someone, do not forget to take some "me" time in the process. Take some time off to 
            relax and do something you enjoy. Neither you nor the person you are helping will benefit if you are constantly under distress.</div>

            <div class="portion-heading">Attempt to connect them with professional help.</div>
            <div class="portion-body">If you feel helpless in supporting them or if you feel that their mental health is affecting their daily 
            lives and they may benefit from further support, try to get them to talk with industry professionals who are specialists in such issues.</div>

                <div class="portion-heading">Tell them you're worried</div>
                <div class="portion-body">This might be a good way to open up a conversation. It also shows you care about that person and have time for them – and that they do not have to avoid you.</div>

                <div class="portion-body">Do what you usually do – behaving differently can make someone feel more isolated. Do not be afraid to offer kind words and a space to talk, whether by phone, messaging or in person.</div>

                <div class="portion-body">The first time someone mentions their worries is a big step. It's good to recognise this and reassure them. Let them know you're there to listen when they need to talk.</div>

                <div class="portion-heading">Offer your time to listen</div>
                <div class="portion-body">Listening is an important skill. Ask open questions that start with "how", "what", "where" or "when". This can help people open up.</div>

                <div class="portion-body">Do not force someone to talk to you or get help, or go to a GP on their behalf, as it might make them feel uncomfortable. Gently explore their reasons and listen without judgement, as this might help them to work out what to do.</div>
